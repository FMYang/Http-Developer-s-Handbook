#### Formatting Information with HTML

Because thepurpose of the Web is the common exchange and distribution of information, a universal format for this information is needed so that the content is in a predictable format. HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, is the chosen format, although other formats, such as XML \(Extensible Markup Language\), are gaining respect. XHTML is a markup language that is basically XML-compliant HTML.

HTML consists of tags, where each tag can have any number of attributes, including none. The basic format is as follows:

```html
<tag_name attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">
```

As a Web developer, you need an extensive understanding of HTML, but knowing HTML alone does little to set you apart from everyone else. If you need to find out more information about HTML, I suggestthe W3C's site located at[http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/](http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/default.htm).
