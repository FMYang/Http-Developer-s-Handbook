#### Chapter 2. The Internet and the World Wide Web

The Web is aservice that runs on the Internet. In order to understand how the Web operates, it is important to see how the Internet and the Web are related. For some people, the Web and the Internet are terms that are used almost interchangeably. This, unfortunately, adds a bit of mystery and confusion. Some people use the terms interchangeably as an exaggerated expression of the Web's importance. Either way, the Internet and the Web are two separate entities entirely.

The Web is something most people can conceive to a point, because they are familiar with using it. The Internet, on the other hand, is more or less hidden from view, because it is more of an idea than a physical entity. People know they must be connected to the Internet somehow in order to make use of services such as email and the Web, but there is verylittle reason to know much beyond that.
