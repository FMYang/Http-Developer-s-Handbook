#### Summary

This should give you a good introduction to the basics of HTTP transactions. It is important to remember that an HTTP transaction consists of a single HTTP request and the corresponding HTTP response, but that multiple transactions are sometimes required for a single Web page to be ultimately rendered in your Web browser. In the next chapter, I explain some Web development techniques that leverage knowledge of HTTP to make Web development easier and of higher quality.
