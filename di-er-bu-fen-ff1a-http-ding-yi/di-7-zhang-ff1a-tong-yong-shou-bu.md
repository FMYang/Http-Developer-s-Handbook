#### Chapter 7. General Headers

General headers can be included in either HTTP requests or HTTP responses. In most cases, these include generic information about the HTTP transaction itself. For example, there are general headers for controlling caching behavior, specifying the date the HTTP message was sent, managing connections, and so on.

This chapter discusses each of the general headers as defined in HTTP/1.1.
