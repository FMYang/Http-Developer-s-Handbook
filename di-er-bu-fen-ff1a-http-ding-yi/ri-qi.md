#### Date

The Date header indicates the system time on the system that generated the HTTP message. Thus, the Date header in an HTTP request indicates the system time on the Web client (the user's PC, for example) when the request was generated. In the HTTP response, it indicates when the response was generated on the Web server. The format of a Date header should be as follows:

`Date: Tue, 21 May 2002 12:34:56 GMT`
