#### Summary

This chapter should give you a better understanding of the impact HTTP general headers can have on Web transactions. Truly, general headers dictate a great deal about the flow of information on the Web, and many of the topics presented here are further explained in a more applicable manner in later chapters.

The following chapter defines and explains entity headers. These headers relate specifically to the content of an HTTP message, and Chapter 8 concludes the definition with regard to HTTP headers. The book will continue with formatting specifications and media types before discussing ways to apply what you have learned to your own development.
