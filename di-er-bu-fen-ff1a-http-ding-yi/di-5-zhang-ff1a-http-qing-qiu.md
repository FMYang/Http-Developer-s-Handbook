#### Chapter 5. HTTP Requests

In the next few chapters, we willexamine the HTTP definition in great detail. These chapters merge the relevant formal definitions related to HTTP with the real-world implementations. The purpose of this part of the book \(Chapters[5](itss://chm/0672324547_ch05.html#ch05)-[10](itss://chm/0672324547_ch10.html#ch10)\) is to serve as an indispensable guide for Web developers interacting with the HTTP protocol directly as well as those interacting with the software that implements HTTP. The focus, therefore, is on the information as it pertains to Web development.

Although I present these topics in order of relevance, the organizational style is more like a reference than a tutorial. Keep this in mind as you plan your approach. Rather than skimming this part, however, your time will be well served by gaining a good working knowledge of the HTTP definition. This will give you a better foundation to build on as you continue with the task-oriented information covered in Chapters[14](itss://chm/0672324547_ch14.html#ch14)-[23](itss://chm/0672324547_ch23.html#ch23).

As you saw in[Chapter 3](itss://chm/0672324547_ch03.html#ch03), "HTTP Transactions," an HTTP message is unlike most lower-level protocols. Rather than being comprised of fixed-length fields of bits, HTTP messages are readable and intuitive. As you examine the elements of HTTP messages in detail, this characteristic will serve you well. In this chapter, you will gain more understanding about the examples you have seen as well as examine several additional ones.

In order to thoroughly cover HTTP requests, this chapter focuses on:

* Defining the basic syntax of an HTTP request.

* Exploring the different types of request methods available.

* Explaining each of the HTTP request headers.
