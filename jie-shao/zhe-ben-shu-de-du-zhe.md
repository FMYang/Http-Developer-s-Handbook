#### Audience for This Book

There are many benefits to gaining a thorough understanding of HTTP, and anyone in the Web development field should take the time to do so. This knowledge is beneficial to anyone who creates content for the Web, whether this content is a single page, an entire site, or even a sophisticated application or service. HTTP defines the formalities of the communication between a Web client, such as a Web browser, and a Web server. Simply put, HTTP is what powers the Web. Understanding HTTP not only allows you to understand how the Web works, it also gives you important insight into its fundamental architecture. This provides a very important foundation for any Web developer to build from.

As the World Wide Web gains in popularity, more and more development software is being created to further abstract the details of Web development. The intent is to make it easier for beginners to write software for the Web without much experience. Although this can potentially accelerate the development process, it creates a dangerous dependency on these tools without a thorough understanding of what they are doing. Those with this fundamental knowledge will have a distinct advantage over those who do not, and they will also be able to adapt as the industry evolves.

This book is intended primarily for Web developers, although systems administrators, network administrators, and security officers responsible for maintaining, deploying, or securing Web applications should also be very familiar with this essential protocol. Truly, anyone involved in the development cycle for Web content or who is interested in learning more about the Web can benefit from reading this book.

Some Web developers rely on software to develop for the Web, but the future of Web development promises to require developers to have a complete understanding of the environment in which they develop. Knowing HTTP gives you the freedom from these tools and allows you to fit into any development environment as your career evolves.

A Web developer is anyone who is involved in the creative process of developing content for the Web. A Web developer's responsibilities can consist of any of the following:

* **Programming**—These are the people who actually write the majority of the code that powers the application.

* **Interface Design**—These are the people who design the flow of the application from a user's perspective as well as the page layout and visual design.

* **Architectural Design**—These are the people who design the structure of the application from a technical perspective.

* **Security Analysis**—These are the people responsible for properly assessing and mitigating all security risks and determining whether these risks are acceptable.

* **Quality Assurance**—These are the people responsible for making sure the application works correctly as well as documenting all problems accurately for the programmers.

In many development environments, individual people do not hold these roles. Rather, the roles are shared among a group of people according to their individual talents. For this reason, it is beneficial to your career to become familiar with all the roles a Web developer may assume.
