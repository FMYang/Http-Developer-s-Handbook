#### Advantages of Understanding HTTP

There are many key benefits to having a working knowledge of HTTP. A few of these are described in the following sections.

#### Adapting to New Trends and Technologies

By understanding the underlying architecture of the Web, you can adapt to new trends and technologies. With such an enormous base of HTTP clients \(Web browsers\) in the world, any new Web technology seeking quick adoption will have to be compliant with HTTP in order to communicate with the client. Even Web services use HTTP as the primary means of transporting data, so those with knowledge of HTTP are already a step ahead.

#### Creating Intelligent Architectures for Web Applications

Without understanding the Web environment, it can be difficult to create a well-organized and elegant construction of any application. By gaining a deeper understanding of how information travels on the Web, you can create more intelligent architectures for your applications that will help you maintain consistent interfaces, top-notch security, and better organization. This not only makes the application substantially easier to develop, but also means it is easier to ensure quality for your customers.

#### Understanding Web Transactions

Many traditional programmers find the Web difficult to program for due to the stateless nature of Web transactions \(See[Chapter 11](itss://chm/0672324547_ch11.html#ch11)for an explanation of state\). In many cases, traditional programmers will have a deeper understanding of many of the raw programming aspects than someone who began their career as a Web developer, and a good understanding of HTTP is all that separates them from becoming one of the very best Web developers in the world.

#### Understanding HTTP Headers

Most professional programming languages designed for developing Web applications— such as PHP, ColdFusion, and JSP—allow the developers to alter or create their own HTTP headers. This ability can allow developers to control any behavior of the Web transaction they choose, such as protocol-level redirects, setting cookies, controlling caching behavior, and the like. With a basic understanding of HTTP combined with a trustworthy reference, you can take complete control of your Web application.

#### Creating Secure and Efficient Session Management

Because of the stateless nature of the Web, some people have the opinion that session management is an ugly hack of the Web environment. However, these myths can be dispelled with a more thorough understanding of the environment, and there are elegant and secure solutions to maintaining sessions that I illustrate in detail.

#### Increasing Performance

There are so many ways to increase performance in an application that it is best to learn about the industry's best practices and decide which methods are appropriate for your specific application. By explaining topics such as caching, connections, compression, and range requests, this book can not only help you increase performance in your existing applications, but it can also help you to gain the crucial knowledge you need to design your future applications to be quick and efficient from the beginning. The intent of this book is to give you the knowledge you need to decide what is best for you.

#### Debugging Sophisticated Applications

There is no better way to debug a sophisticated Web application than to view the HTTP transactions in question. By doing this, a developer can quickly determine whether the source of the problem is in the HTTP request from the Web browser or the HTTP response from the Web server. Unfortunately, browsers often have bugs that prevent them from performing certain tasks correctly. It is important for a developer to be able to analyze this behavior carefully in order to avoid it. Alternatively, if the problem is in fact in the HTTP response, the developer can quickly identify the problem and begin work toward resolving it.

#### Assessing and Mitigating Security Risks

It is impractical to attempt to assess the security of a Web application without having any idea about the information being sent and received as users browse your site. Unfortunately, this practice of making guesses with regards to security is far too common, and the result is that many Web applications are far less secure than their creators would like to believe. Rather than trusting in the security of vague suggestions, it is much safer to develop your own security expertise and apply that to each unique application.

All of these important topics are covered in great detail. There are likely many other useful applications of HTTP expertise, because such knowledge will make you a verita-ble expert of the Web. The application of this knowledge is entirely up to you.
