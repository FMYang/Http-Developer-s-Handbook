#### Other Sources of Information

The best way to begin any search for information is to go straight to the source. In this case, that source is the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C. The W3C's home on the Web is[http://www.w3.org/](http://www.w3.org/default.htm).

The home for the HTTP protocol is[http://www.w3.org/Protocols/](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/default.htm).

From there, it is possible to browse through a great deal of information relating to HTTP and the Web in general, including current and past activity, history of the Web, and the various standards.

Another great source of information is the RFC \(Request For Comments\) documents themselves, which for far too long have been the only adequate source of information regarding HTTP and related protocols. Unfortunately, the RFC documents are sometimes not in perfect synchronization with the industry, due to the fact that the industry evolves on demand rather than waiting for standards to be created and agreed upon to satisfy a specific need. In addition to this, most RFCs introduced as proposed standards are integrated into software prior to being formally accepted. For these reasons and more, this book is a crucial part of any Web developer's library, as it balances the formal specifications with the real-world implementations.

The RFCs most relevant to HTTP are as follows:
