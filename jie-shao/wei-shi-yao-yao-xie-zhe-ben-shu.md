#### **Why This Book?**

Many developers of free software \(see[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)for a definition of free software\) gain motivation from a personal need. Sometimes described as "scratching your own itch", this has long been a source of inspiration behind some of the world's most important and successful software. The result is often of superior quality compared to the proprietary equivalents. This can be attributed to the increased passion and diligence developers possess when developing software they want to work on rather than software they have to work on because of employment or financial obligations.

This is one of my primary sources of motivation for writing this book. I am, in many ways, scratching my own itch. After searching for a good book on HTTP for a few years, and after being dissatisfied with the vast amounts of time that I would have to put into researching and interpreting the RFC documents to find the information I need, I decided the industry was in desperate need of this book. After all, a developer's time is better spent developing software.

In addition to this, I have accumulated a wealth of information in my career concerning best practices in Web development, and this type of information goes well with the discussion of the Web's fundamental architecture. I hope to help my readers learn from my mistakes rather than having to make the same mistakes themselves
