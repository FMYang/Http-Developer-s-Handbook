#### The Growing Importance of HTTP

In order for you to remain competitive in today's market as a professional Web developer, it is important remain abreast of the latest trends in technology as well as choose which trends are appropriate for the tasks you are responsible for.

There are many technologies that have been introduced after activity on HTTP itself closed. Among these are Web services, WebDAV, P3P, and so on. Those with a solid foundation of knowledge about the Web can acquire expertise in new technologies with increased ease. This is the type of knowledge that I hope to share with you in this book.

SOAP is the protocol standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium for Web services, and HTTP is the most common transport used to exchange SOAP messages. Thus, implementing Web services will require many developers to become familiar with both HTTP and SOAP. This is just one more example of how knowledge of HTTP can help you to adapt to new technologies.

In April 2002, the W3C unveiled its formal recommendation for P3P, the Platform for Privacy Preferences. This platform allows users to gain more control over the ways in which Web sites can make use of their personal information. In order to be consistent with existing Web software, P3P is tightly integrated with HTTP and even includes extensions to the HTTP headers.

Distributed authoring is another topic of interest to some Web developers, and it is another technology that involves extensive integration with HTTP and its own HTTP headers. This idea allows for methods of editing and managing files on remote Web servers. Because all Web servers adhere to HTTP, it is the obvious technology to use with distributed authoring, as it does not require any special server configurations.
