#### Organization of This Book

This book has four logical pieces, although they are not specifically labeled as such.

#### Introduction and Part I

The first part of the book introduces the concepts of the World Wide Web and how HTTP makes it all happen. This section spends time describing the benefits of this book as well as introducing some important foundational information that is expanded upon elsewhere. Here I'll go over the first complete Web transaction, although many of the principles are not covered until later. The more experienced readers can likely skim this section of the book and focus on the content found in later chapters.

#### Part II

[Part II](itss://chm/0672324547_part02.html#part02)is a conclusive reference to the HTTP protocol. Unlike any information available through other sources, this part collects all of the relevant information about this important protocol and combines it into one well-explained and up-to-date collection. Uses of each of the topics in this section are provided, although this information is categorized and elaborated upon in the rest of the book

#### Parts III, IV, and V

This piece of the book is the most extensive. Here you will find detailed explanations and descriptions of many of the uses of HTTP as well as common Web development issues. You will learn more about the various ways to increase the performance of your Web application, methods to use to ensure the security of your data, and good coding standards to apply to your development. This material will provide the most universal benefit to all Web developers, regardless of experience.

#### Part VI

The final part explains some of the standards organizations involved in technologies like HTTP. It also gives a glimpse into the future of HTTP with some of the latest trends to utilize this protocol.
