#### Internet Engineering Task Force

The Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF, is a group that is more open than the W3C in the sense that it has no specific group of members or dues as the W3C does. It consists of an international community of people contributing to the continued maintenance of the Internet and its associated standards. Standards are published as RFCs (Request for Comments), and these standards are proposed as Internet Drafts and go through a series of revisions based on community feedback.

The RFCs themselves mature over time. However, in order to allow for consistency, once an Internet Draft is proposed as an RFC, it is never revised. If changes to the RFC are deemed necessary, and entirely new RFC is proposed that obsoletes the old.

As a standard gains credibility, it evolves from a Proposed Standard, to a Draft Standard, and finally to an Internet Standard. History has shown that this process of evolution is extremely slow compared to evolution of the technologies created to interoperate with these standards. Thus, many technologies are widely deployed and put into practice long before they reach the status of Internet Standard.

#### Summary

HTTP can be considered the bridge between the IETF and the W3C, as it provides the glue between the Internet and the Web. The W3C mostly concerns itself with technologies that rely on HTTP and deals with the representation and architecture of the Web itself, whereas the IETF's involvement in the Web only extends to HTTP.

Open standards are a major contributing factor to the success of the Internet and the Web as global mediums of communication. As a Web developer, it is important to appreciate the efforts of organizations such as those described here and the open standards that they make possible. As a token of appreciation and respect, every developer should make it a priority to always adhere to these standards as closely as possible in order to give strength to their credibility, as well as to the technologies that they support, such as the Web.
