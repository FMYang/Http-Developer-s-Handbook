#### World Wide Web Consortium

The World Wide Web Consortium, W3C, is an organization founded by the Web's creator, Tim Berners-Lee, in 1994. As an organization, its primary focus is the continued evolution of the Web from a technical perspective. Most technologies related to the Web either originate as W3C recommendations or are standardized by the W3C in order to lend credibility to the technology.

The W3C also contributes utilities to aid developers that seek to implement a standard. These mostly come in the form of validation services or open source software implementations.

Most activities of the W3C are organized into Working Groups. These groups are organized into five domains of activity:

* Architecture

* Document formats

* Interaction

* Technology and society

* Accessibility

HTTP is an activity of the architecture domain. However, as HTTP is itself an Internet protocol that simply provides the foundation for the Web, its control was relegated to the Internet Engineering Task Force, the governing body (or closest thing to it) for Internet standards.
