#### Chapter 25. The Future of HTTP

HTTP will most likely see no further activity. The W3C Web site (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/) makes the following statement:

"Now that both HTTP extensions and HTTP/1.1 are stable specifications, W3C has closed the HTTP Activity. The Activity has achieved its goal of creating a successful standard that addresses the weaknesses of earlier HTTP versions."

However, this has not stopped the trend of building useful technologies that use HTTP as a primary means of communication. As the previous statement references, there is an extension framework for HTTP that allows new technologies to extend the existing protocol. This extension framework is defined in RFC 2774, and there are already a few ideas that take advantage of extending HTTP. This chapter provides a brief overview of three of these technologiesâ€”SOAP, WebDAV, and P3P.
